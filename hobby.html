<br><h1>On my free time I like to play Cricket. It is a fun and execiting sport. Many people do not know about cricket as it is very similar to baseball but they are simplier rules and regulations. In cricket there are no home runs but we do have boundaries which could either be 4 or 6. Also, each batsman only get one try to bat. Cricket to me is a techincal and interesting game as the wind, temperature and location affects the way the ball is bounced.
